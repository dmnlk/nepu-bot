## Victor

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brettbuddin/victor.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/brettbuddin/victor)

**Victor** is a library for creating your own chat bot.

We use Victor as the backbone of our bot, Virbot, within our team Slack chat at Virb (http://virb.com). We use him for all sorts things like:

- Deploying code
- Preparing/initiating builds of our projects
- Viewing information about our infrastructure
- CDN operations
- Jokes and laughs

### Supported Services

I currently have adapters written for [Slack](https://slack.com/) and [Campfire](https://campfirenow.com/), however more are to come. Writing an adapter for your favorite service is a good way to contribute to the project :wink:.

### Making Him Your Own

Victor is more of a framework for constructing your own bot so he doesn't do a whole lot out-of-the-box. I'll be adding more default behavior to him as time progresses. You can use the programs located in `examples/` as starting points to create your own executable.
